hwit
====

hwit is a toy whiteboard app made with [BackboneJS](http://backbonejs.org/), [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) and [Redis](http://redis.io/).

Playing with the idea of dynamic html-editable elements.

Double-click to start a new box.

You can type stuff. There aren't any rich text controls, but you can paste HTML copied from a browser or browser-like interface.

Contents are persisted.


IDEAS:
- panning interface
- basic rich text with key-commands like âŒ˜B
- drop-in images
- move boxes
